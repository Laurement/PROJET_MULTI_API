      "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>The nascent Hand first formed about 800 years ago in feudal <a href=\"/japan/4020-55746/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55746\">Japan</a>, as a reaction to the oppressive class system that characterized Japanese society in that period. A number of Japanese citizens left their homes and settled in the mountains. There, they cultivated skill in ninjutsu, and through rigorous training became experts at assassination and espionage. The group officially came together in 1588 under the command of <a href=\"/kagenobu-yoshioka/4005-1798/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1798\">Kagenobu Yoshioka</a>, who turned his samurai school into a bastion of support for the common man. Yoshioka was eventually assassinated, and command of the group co-opted by the <a href=\"/snakeroot/4060-56349/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56349\">Snakeroot</a>, an ancient ninja clan who turned the Hand to demon worship and black magic. The Hand began working as mercenaries, and sought to extend its influence throughout the world.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Hand was created by <a href=\"/frank-miller/4040-7082/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-7082\">Frank Miller</a>.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><p>The Hand consists largely of unknown masked people, but has featured numerous named characters at various points in its history. Throughout its history various heroes have been press-ganged into service by the dark magic of the Hand. They have also employed numerous villains.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Chaste</h3><p>The Hand comes into constant conflict with a heroic group known as the <a href=\"/chaste/4060-55828/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55828\">Chaste</a>. This conflict is the first encounter with the Hand experienced by both <a href=\"/daredevil/4005-24694/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24694\">Daredevil</a> and <a href=\"/elektra/4005-1802/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1802\">Elektra</a>, with the latter first infiltrating and later joining the Hand for a time. The conflict eventually results in the defeat of the Hand, but also in the deaths of the Chaste's leader, <a href=\"/stick/4005-11018/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11018\">Stick</a>, and a member of the group named <a href=\"/shaft/4005-5182/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5182\">Shaft</a>.</p><h3>Enemy of the State</h3><p>The Hand, alongside scion organization <a href=\"/hydra/4060-3480/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3480\">HYDRA</a> and the mutant group Dawn of the White Light, orchestrates the abduction of <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a>. They brainwash him, and set him loose, intending to use him as the weapon he was designed to be to kill members of the superhero community. They send numerous operatives out across the world to deal with opponent superheroes, with limited success. They manage to kill and resurrect Elektra and <a href=\"/northstar/4005-3190/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3190\">Northstar</a>, both of whom are brainwashed to act as weapons for the Hand and HYDRA. Meanwhile, Wolverine escapes his brainwashing and turns on the Hand, commandeering a <a href=\"/sentinels/4060-4296/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-4296\">Sentinel</a> and invading their headquarters, destroying many of the Hand's members, as well as the organization's elite, with the assistance of Elektra, who had also managed to escape her conditioning.</p><h3>Shadowland</h3><p>Daredevil takes over command of the Hand after the Hand's repeated attempts to acquire a new warlord. He constructs a new headquarters for them in <a href=\"/hells-kitchen/4020-42295/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42295\">Hell's Kitchen</a>, called <a href=\"/shadowland/4020-57004/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57004\">Shadowland</a>, and dedicates himself into remodelling the group into a force for good. The group begins to corrupt him instead. After Daredevil kills <a href=\"/bullseye/4005-4647/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4647\">Bullseye</a>, he and members of the Hand crash the funeral and engage in a massive brawl which almost results in the death of the captive <a href=\"/ben-urich/4005-4799/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4799\">Ben Urich</a>. After a number of clashes between the Hand and the members of the superhero community, it is revealed that Daredevil is possessed by the demonic <a href=\"/the-beast/4005-61555/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61555\">Beast of the Hand</a>. He is defeated and apparently kills himself; in the ensuing confusion, control of the Hand is seized by <a href=\"/kingpin/4005-1483/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1483\">Kingpin</a> and <a href=\"/typhoid-mary/4005-1536/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1536\">Typhoid Mary</a>.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Film</h3><p><strong><i>Elektra</i></strong></p><p>The Hand appears as the major antagonistic organization in this film.</p><p><strong><em>The Wolverine</em></strong></p><p>A similar organization known as the Black Ninja Clan appears in this film. They are a powerful group of ninja who have protected <a href=\"/mariko-yashida/4005-3196/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3196\">Mariko Yashida</a>'s family for generations, and are led by<a href=\"/silver-samurai/4005-3174/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3174\"> Harada</a>.</p><h3>Television</h3><p><strong><em>Daredevil</em></strong></p><p>One of the recurring villains in the first season is a Japanese criminal known as Nobu (played by Peter Shinkoda). Though initially believed to be part of the Yakuza, he turns out to be part of a mysterious, ancient syndicate from Japan, which is heavily implied to be the Hand. During his final fight with Daredevil, Nobu dons a red ninja outfit similar to the ones worn by members of the Hand in the comics.</p><h3>Video Games</h3><p><strong><i>X-Men: Wolverine's Rage</i></strong></p><p>The Hand appear as antagonists.</p><p><strong><i>X-Men vs Street Fighter </i></strong></p><p>The Hand appears briefly and attempts to draw <a href=\"/cammy/4005-42698/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42698\">Cammy</a> into their organization.</p><p><strong><i>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</i></strong></p><p>The Hand appears as an antagonistic organization in this game.</p><p><strong><i>Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3</i></strong></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4727158-7258064898-maxre.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4727158\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4727158-7258064898-maxre.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4727158\"><img alt=\"The Hand hideout in MVC3\" src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4727158-7258064898-maxre.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4727158-7258064898-maxre.jpg 1280w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/4727158-7258064898-maxre.jpg 960w, http://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4727158-7258064898-maxre.jpg 480w, http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4727158-7258064898-maxre.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>The Hand hideout in MVC3</figcaption></figure><p>Members of the Hand appear, as does the Hand's headquarters and Shadowland.</p><p><strong><i>Marvel: Avengers Alliance </i></strong></p><p>Various members of the Hand appear in this game.</p>",
